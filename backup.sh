# Removes Oldest Backup - daily the oldest non Friday 
# backup is  removed.  On Friday backups the oldest 
# Friday backup is removed.
# Backup creation/removal is 1 for 1 so if the total 
# number of backups retained needs to change it will 
# need to be done manuall.
#
# The cron job that fires this is:
# 0 5 * * 1-6 /usr/local/bin/ics/test/backup.sh 
# this starts the script at 5 am Sunday through Friday 
# skipping a rename on the saturday backup.
